*Thank you William!     *

Good morning- today is Series S4L and the SPILL is UP.. Yesterday most
certainly DID NOT possess a trending feature..In fact it was a very
compressed range @ 7 handles RTH large contract ..In a sign of weakness
 the last our high was early and weak.Another tell of weakness  showed its’
hand at that early and weak high as well: a break out bar on the  E-MINI
occurred and took cash 54 cents on cash over the MOE-2handles used on cash
to identify EXACT hits on pencil and eraser work (elliott wave).. WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN???

In an effort to answer this I have included a CASH chart on 3 min time
frame with a best effort count..If you are not familiar with EW do not let
this daunt you or get bogged down in the weeds. It is the WHAT NEXT THAT
MATTERS --It MEANS the red box on the right should try to hold any decline
and if the red horizontal line is broken then the 3? And 4? Are wrong and
the 5 =1 OR LARGER IS CORRECT AND THE Horizontal LINE ;SACROSANCT’ is
confirmation.It means the BULLS  are then in DIRE NEED of DEFENDING 2085
CASH where the FLAT focused upon on Friday last week in real time and
defined in the Monday COMMENTARY.That low was the ORIGIN for finding the
32.44 + 2085+ would act as RESISTANCE +,- MOE 2 handles.. Now lets put this
to PRICE on FUTURES and blend in the ROLL OVER ..

Ok, today is -10.41 FV futures vs. cash. For those who choose to still
trade June today, I did include the JUNE NUMBAHS in a separate document.
BY SIMPLY subtracting 10-10.5 handles from cash you can readily see that
2100 BIG ROUNDIE , 2095.5 , 2095.1 weekly pivot (this will change Friday
/do not let that throw you for a loop , and 2091.5 SPOT are correlated
perfectly to the .26 to .5 retraces  where one would expect a WAVE 4 to
terminate…On OFFENSE you can readily see that  10-10.5 + 2112 SPOT gives a
CASH value that shifts everything in the bull favor to go after higher CASH
resistance in the 2130-234 CASH zone given earlier in the week  as the next
set of larger FIBS…   ALTHOUGH it would be very very low odds without an
event TODAY  you should also be able to easily GLEAN where the BEARS will
committed again to a larger BEAR MOVE..the 2075.5 SPOT !!! due to the 2085
LARGER CASH SUPPORT!!! --SO BEARS COMMITTED 2075.5 SPOT CONFIRMED 2068 spot
of course!!! (2077 less FV within MOE)...Because I wanted to focus on
ROLLOVER and the weak action yesterday  at day end (not killing 2120.01
cash) those committed and confirmed prices will have to suffice for the
FOLLOW UP to yesterday’s LARGER PICTURE  charts for a little longer --

HONING AND SYNOPSIS..the day should go SPILL UP, A,M. LOW, MID A.M. HIGH ,
LUNCH LOW, MID P.M.HIGH, and last Hour low .The BEARS need to use
yesterday’s compressed range and last hour weakness with NO FOLLOW THROUGH
on the 2:46 break out bar and weak last hour high..Job 1 for the  Bears is
to kill the 2103.5  ()(**%&(*# !!!! SPOT and go after the weekly pivot
...Job 1 for the BULLS is to go after 2112 SPOT and confirm the market is
indeed going to make the final grind to the all time high zone where
2130-2134 cash fib band resides. On defense there first big battle would
 be defending the .236 retrace on cash AKA the 2100 BIG ROUNDIE ES which is
normally associated with 4th waves that are weak in nature (bullish), FROM
THERE you have everything else laid out above  ...SPOTS TA roundies


   FV -10.41  S4L    06/09/16  SEPTEMBER 2016 contract
Thank you William!     William Blount observations

Good morning -today is Series S4L very slight iffy and the SPILL is up..
Yesterday was similar to a day in Dec. near Christmas. The range was an
abysmal 5.9 Handles large contract, 6.25 ES.THIS TOO SHALL PASS and that is
tied in to yesterday’s larger picture commentary (a keeper for future
reference on commentaries at least until the Tuesday commentary after Labor
Day).

This is EXPIRATION WEEK/Expiration week tends to skew up.  Yesterday’s
compression was augmented by 3.6 handles of gravy in the gap.That is the
movement from Friday CLOSE to Monday Open. The lean on the SPILL was DOWN
calling into question as to rather we would FLIP the LEAN on a MONDAY when
the GAP UP appeared…HERE:

william blount:(9:47:04 AM) : the lean has decent odds now of being flipped
to S3L

:william blount:(10:12:29 AM) : ok, any new HOD will maintain same lean S3H

:william blount:(10:12:40 AM) : any touch of 84.25 flips it

Now let’s get down to failure .From 10:28 a.m. Low to Hod @2190.75 the
overall range was was 2.5 handles.  Between 11:24 and 12:28 we printed a
distinct  triple top, a unicorn on es at 2191.75.The CASH stayed within the
next FIB, 2192 cash,  given on July 21 and often repeated.

The LEAN WAS NOT FLIPPED.The a.m. high was assigned at 2190.5, a scant .25
below what the lunch high assignment @ 2190.75. Nonetheless LUNCH WAS
GREATER THAN A.M. HIGH.This means we look for the mid p.m. low to be
shallow. An attack on the triple top and BESTING BY at least a stop run
reversal price of 2190.75 triple top should occur.This is a very high odds
occurrence, that is why that triple top is referred to as a UNICORN,.It has
a success rate along the lines of INVERTED TREND VALUES.For instance, 5 of
the 7 failures on INVERTED TREND VALUES have come on ranges of less than 7
handles. ..MORE

Now as we were coming into the expected mid p.m. low we knew support was
given at 2184.5/2185.5 , the LOD on opening bar and the assigned SPILL LOW.
HERE:

william blount:(2:16:34 PM) : ok, we got unicorn at 90.75 --we are now in
the mode to start lifting the scales from our eyes in locating the mid p.m.
low

william blount:(2:17:04 PM) : 84.5/85.5 support -- .

william blount:(2:27:53 PM) : lunch greater than a.,m. high by ,25 and a
unicorn at HOD certainly gives the odds to the bulls -- I was not following
the triple top bit in oct 31, 2004 when there was a real hard down
following a lunch high greater than a.m. high

Where the rubber meets the road,FAILURE, synopsis:The risk to the mid p.m.
long is 84.25 and would require a new LOD.THE ODDS overwhelmingly favor a
touch of 2091 due to the triple top and the lean is for a last hour high
because lunch is greater than the a.m. high even if by only .25 of one
handle. We are trading in reduced TONE  (ranges and volatility); therefore,
the

Decision is simple : Given this same opportunity 100 X , DO I TAKE THIS
LONG  at 88.75 offered w/ initial stop 84.25 or not. My answer is YES, every
time.The next big issue is when to  move the stop from 84.25.My answer,
when price show bottom 88.5 AFTER it crosses through 90 ROUNDIE and limit
to sell at 90.75 for +2. WHY 90.75?? That is actually given above.The odds
strongly favor last hour touch of 91 and in order to ASSURE THE FILL  the
price is 90.75 on the limit. This trade resulted in FAILURE with a stop out
at 88 as price TOPPED at 90.25 and an extremely weak last hour high printed
at  90 ROUNDIE -see 3:10… Now, if that set up occurs 100x and only has a 70
% success outcome , you figure the +2 vs. -.75 on that W/L ratio.The odds
are actually better than that of winning… The key is getting the initial
stop moved .

Finally, the above trade requires that one understand what is meant by YOU
MUST USE A SCALPEL in COMPRESSED TONE TRADING .This is NOT a TONE currently
where VOLATILITY COVERS MANY SINS.This is actually, like it or not, where
minnow trading/sardine trading is the best ,uh , only   game in town…

HONING-Today is S4L very slightly iffy .The slightly iffy is due to the
FACT that the day yesterday reads best as S3H but the last hour failure or
the residual SPILL low at 2185.5 inform that one team or the other colored
outside the lines -TIME IS A STANDARD DEVIATION - slightly. My opinion is
that the last hour was very weak as the FIB rejected price on cash within
MOE.Today :

The bears GET A SHOT AND ARE IN MUST PERFORM -- that performance JOB 1 is
to  go after the 2177.5 SPOT aka WEEKLY PIVOT.Remember they DO NOT
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OF REAL VALUE until they take out 2168 CASH. .The BULLS
JOB is simple also :

They NEED to get price through 2191 and go after the big roundie on cash at
2200 BY KILLING THE cash FIB at 2192 with MOE at 2194 cash on the upper
side. SPOTS TA ROUNDIES. NO CHARTS TODAY -- the next decent catalyst is
tomorrow at 2 p.m. FOMC minutes --remember from 12 noon today through 12
noon on Thursday  several turns are often overwhelmed by EXPIRY FUN AND
GAMES..
