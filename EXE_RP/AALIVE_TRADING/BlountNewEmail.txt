Thank you William!



Good morning - today is SERIES S3L and the SPILL is UP.It is WILD CARD
DAYas to pattern and the day will be SPILL UP,a.m. low, mid a.m. high,
lunch low, mid p.m. high, last hour low… more

Yesterday was a weak version of the S2L NORMAL with 2 tells : one bullish
and the other bearis.

The open was 2234.8  aka the 2235 SPOT.The most frustrating aspect of the
day for the minnow/sardine was  FAIR VALUE being out of SYNCH around two
handles basis the information provided by Indexarb.com. It was not just
true of the new contract, March 2017.It also showed its’ hand on the Dec.
2016  contract basis the Wed. close. I mentioned this in the room both Wed.
and Thursday rollover. In volatility expansion  with VIX 30+ that kind of
noise is part of the play but when ranges are more compressed on balance
due to volatility squeeze out this is a tougher nut to crack. The good
news:

This is the first time in 14 years I have seen this happen and  I attribute
it to the a probable miscalculation in the impact of short term interest
component being used by the site.Today, the  FV @ 6.16 looks right when one
contrasts kay cash nano prices vs futures from yesterday and Wednesday.
Without belaboring the point much further let me give you a real example
featuring the commentary yesterday…  more

The SUGAR PLUM FAIRY price for bulls from the  HONING SECTION was 2250
cash. We had an es spot tied to it: 2242.5 , YET the market was trading
 2244 LOC HOD at lunch -see  12:50 p.m.-- NOW KNOW THIS , during the day FV
Value does expand and contract and is used as a TELL for programs entering
and exiting the market.HOWEVER, when it trades very near FV throughout the
move , providing less arbitrage opportunities, that tells you that rather
than FV being -8.02 as given , the FV was consistently trading close to
-6.25 all day.This clearly tells you something is wrong ..VOILA , the FV
today is -6.16 .Another reason this is very critical besides wreaking havoc
on entries  and exits in tight trading (ROPE FOLLOWS EXPANDED)  is
something written 100’s of times : CASH IS THE DOG, FUTURES ARE THE
TAIL..FUTURES LIE, CASH DOES NOT(this last maxim is even more important in
wave counting and rules applied using Elliott).. Now back to the bull and
bear tell ..

Once the SPILL sealed  2238.5 as the expected high , we dove perfectly to
the a.m. low at  2231.5 and the need for the move to the LUNCH high in
order to track the NORMAL required first, a move back through the 2235
SPOT, 2234.8 open but more importantly a TOUCH of 2238.75 in order to take
out the SPILL high. We double topped that price EXACTLY @ 11:24 and then
SUCCESSFULLY test the 2235 SPOT/open at 2234. 8 @   11:41. The rally
confirmed at 12:21 on the touch and then the acceleration to the lunch high
occurred...more

The first anomaly/aberration occurred on the stop run  if the lunch high,
this was bullish and placed the BEARS in a position of residual pressure
only,  down to the  mid p.m. low.The first sign of weakness was the
breakthrough of the 2242.5 spot ,  but price made an acceptable reversal at
2239.25 at 2:26 and when that price was broken by more than .75 (the outer
edge of the stop run reversal -.25-.75 , THE BEAR tell kicked into place
taking price down to the eventual low and outside the acceptable standard
deviation for the mic p.m. low @ 2:47. FINALLY , the cycle pressure kicked
int pace and produced a laborious up to wet beak the 2242.5 SPOT and
CLOSING lower than the lunch high. This is WEAK. Now, all this blow by blow
 was given in order to shape today;s HONING .

HONNG: The weak close obviously gives the Bea a shot today. The BULLS need
to go after and convert 2250 cash. 3 new spots were issued in the event
yesterday produce the NORMAL last hour HOF . They are :2248., 53. And 57
..The 2257 is the larger fib of the 3. The only known ECON Catalyst IS
Michigan SENTIMENT at 10 a.m. ..The BEARS JOB 1 is to take price back
through the 2235 SPOT. and convert it. Use 2235 -2248 and WORK IN … SPOTS
TA ROUNDIES--ps routine check up today at Dr. in the a.m. --hope to be back
before lunch
