*Thank you William!     *

Good morning-today is SERIES S4L and the SPILL is UP-- You have a textbook
rendition of yesterday’s S3H w/ a.m. high greater than lunch high in your
box. I have the scroll saved and suffice to say EVERYTHING ON THIS CHART
WAS GIVEN IN ADVANCE or upon occurrence I do not want to waste time copy
and pasting all the posts but here are some bullets.

Came into day a little concerned about lean-S3H

Described EXACTLY how a triangle was unfolding and what would be the
confirmation THRUST as well as to look for double toppish HI (e) .

Identified and repeated over and over the need for a touch of 2095.75 1
tick above the SPOT for the BULLS to get back in the game once its’ first
pass bounce failed on a back through

Repeated the HONING SECTION FOCUS FOCUS FOCUS EXTRACT THE PRICES EXTRACT
THE PRICES critical FIRST NEED FOR THE BEARS then after the lunch pressure
died and the back through of the 91.5 occurred used as first big need for
bulls WHEN the mid p.m. sealed…

(KUDOS to NIELS from Amsterdam  for his timely 2086 ‘balanced price as it
helped to nail the first pass assignment @2086.5 of the mid p.m. low that
FAILED to reach 2091.5  bu assisted in the re-entry upon completion of
triangle 2 @87 AND to the IRISH for the “U” inquiry around 1 p.m that
assisted on the THRUST back to 95.5!!! For last hour high  ) ..leave it at
this: add this weak variant of a textbook S3H with a.m. high greater than
lunch high to your collection , how triangles work how the spots are
integrated for TRACKING.. Time stamps do not lie and neither does cash

Ok, this treatment of S3H  yesterday interrupts the larger picture analysis
commentary and since there have been several S4L treatments distributed
recently I will not due a nano educational piece for tomorrow regardless of
how compelling as the larger picture is more critical in my opinion at this
juncture…

BRIEFLY--OH NO  NOT YOU AGAIN *&^%$%^2103.5 TRAPPED in off hours, a FAILURE
to go after it in the far more important RTH (regular trading hours).... A
weak S3H as the OPEN and a.m. High were NOT RECOVERED regardless of last
hour high ..

HONING-- the BEARS have an  opening to follow though and go after the
2080-2083 (weekly pivot 2079.9 if they can keep 2095.5 SPOT from being
converted to HARD SUPPORT. Their  first offensive need is to kill 2091.5
SPOT  and go after that 2080/weekly pivot - 2083 SPOT.The BULLS first need
is to get and keep the 2095.5 SPOT converted to support and then finally go
after the 2013.5 ^*&(^%*(&_ where it matters ,IN RTH. Yesterday we made a
NEW CASH HIGH during day 8 of the 5-8 DAY out of the hole move off the
2025.91 CASH LOW. I see that high as 5 waves up 3 of 5 from that 2025.91
CASH low -- what the battle is about is HOW DEEP does this retrace  of
 2025.91-2103.48 go -- It also makes that 2025.91 cash EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
TO WAVE STRUCTURE and that wil be in the larger picture follow up
tomorrow..SPOTS TA ROUNDIES--S4L-spill up , a.m. low, mid a.m. high, lunch
low, mid p.m. high last hour low BEIGE BOOK AT 2 P.M. data point of the day
