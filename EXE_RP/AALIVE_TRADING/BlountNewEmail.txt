Good morning- today is Series S4L and the SPILL is UP.. Yesterday most
certainly DID NOT possess a trending feature..In fact it was a very
compressed range @ 7 handles RTH large contract ..In a sign of weakness
 the last our high was early and weak.Another tell of weakness  showed its’
hand at that early and weak high as well: a break out bar on the  E-MINI
occurred and took cash 54 cents on cash over the MOE-2handles used on cash
to identify EXACT hits on pencil and eraser work (elliott wave).. WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN???

In an effort to answer this I have included a CASH chart on 3 min time
frame with a best effort count..If you are not familiar with EW do not let
this daunt you or get bogged down in the weeds. It is the WHAT NEXT THAT
MATTERS --It MEANS the red box on the right should try to hold any decline
and if the red horizontal line is broken then the 3? And 4? Are wrong and
the 5 =1 OR LARGER IS CORRECT AND THE Horizontal LINE ;SACROSANCT’ is
confirmation.It means the BULLS  are then in DIRE NEED of DEFENDING 2085
CASH where the FLAT focused upon on Friday last week in real time and
defined in the Monday COMMENTARY.That low was the ORIGIN for finding the
32.44 + 2085+ would act as RESISTANCE +,- MOE 2 handles.. Now lets put this
to PRICE on FUTURES and blend in the ROLL OVER ..
